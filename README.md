## 💔 About FreedomGDPS

FreedomGDPS is not the most advanced server.  
It's not the most active.  
And sometimes... it's not even the most stable.  

We know it's far from perfect. Many features are unfinished. Errors happen for no reason.  
But this project is built on the desire to **learn**, **share**, and **create**, even with all our limits.

## ⚠️ Known Flaws & Limitations

- The UI is messy honestly, kind of ugly.  
- Random crashes? Yeah, they're real.  
- No proper level moderation system.  
- Level ratings? Expect chaos.  
- Tools are experimental and unstable.  
- No real security.  
- Database works... when it wants to.  
- Free hosting means... frequent downtime.  
- Not everyone will like it and that’s okay.

## 🙃 Still, We Keep Going

Though small, though broken,  
FreedomGDPS keeps moving because some of us still believe in freedom and creativity.

If you ever felt left out in other servers,  
Maybe you’ll find a little home here.
